# Gender-AgeDetection
This project demonstrates an Age and Gender Detection system implemented using Python. It utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning models to accurately estimate the age and gender of individuals from images or live video feeds.
Key Features:

    Age Estimation: The project employs a pre-trained deep learning model to estimate the age of a person based on facial features.
    Gender Recognition: Using a similar approach, the system predicts the gender of the individual as male or female.
    Real-time Detection: The system is designed to work in real-time, making it suitable for applications like video streaming and surveillance.
    Easy-to-Use Interface: The provided Python scripts and Jupyter Notebook guide users through the process and showcase results with visualizations.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    OpenCV library
    Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
    Pre-trained age and gender classification model
